# RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SEGMENT 3: STUTI BUDHWAR

### Finalized the dashboard and stories in chronological order for the purpose of analysis, visulalization and presentation.

### Worked ont the final power point presentation and Dashboard for the purpose of presentation.

### Finalized on the specific visualizations starting from begining to the Final Dashboard.

### Worked on the interactive elements of the dashboard
This included some reasearch to go beyond the regular interactive elements of tooltip, highlighting and using filters to using advanced ones like animation.

### Detailed and meticulous performance analysis of each models as it evolved in terms of loss and accuracy and what changes in the models helped improvise.
The models included 4 basic models, 2 pretraines VGG16 models and 2 pretrained Resnet Models.

### Visualizing every model in chronological order for 'Loss per Epoch', 'Accuracy per Epoch' using Tableau animation.
Please visit the link refernce for each model in the Visualization_Storyboard_Segment_3_StutiBudhwar.ppt, click Model No. and press play button to see the animated trail of 'Loss and Accuracy per Epoch' for all of the models.

### Comparative analysis of models in chronological order.
Please refer to the link reference  in the Visualization_Storyboard_Segment_3_StutiBudhwar.ppt.

### Strategy for next segment based on the previous analysis and visulaizations.
