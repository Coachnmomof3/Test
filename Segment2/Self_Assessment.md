## Self-Assessment
Self- Assessment: Final Project
Over the tenure of the Final project, due to my love for analyzing large data sets using statistical & analytical knowledge to understand data trends, generate business insights and forecast outcomes using visualization techniques, I took up the analysis and visualizations for the project. It gave me an opportunity to be a part of Machine Learning strategies in the project, and analyze meticulously results for every model, leading to an evolved better next model finally arriving at the best model.
#### Challenges and Solutions: 
Despite having a lot to analyze and relatively lesser scope for visualize for this project, I stretched myself to work on some advanced tableau features like animations for better representation of data/results. 
Solution: The challenge turned out to be an opportunity to learn advanced tableau techniques as animation/parameters and work in depth on better representation of results for the convenience/easy understanding of the audience.
Another challenge was to consolidate all the results of the machine learning models for a meticulous analysis since two of the team mates were working on ML part and their results and data representation was quite different.
Solution: There can be a template that could be shared with the whole team showing the best way of data representation and result for consistence and better analysis.
#### Contribution to other roles of project:
With our exceptional data set, which was images of frontal chest X-rays of patients, the journey of evolving of our data set, tools and technology was an ongoing process through the project which we were all a apart of as a team.
Other than my area of analysis and visualizations using Tableau, I was a part of working on schemas for the data base tables and how they would be joined for the purpose of best representation of our data (image dataset).
I helped consolidating all machine learning model data in terms of model details, architecture, history files (accuracy and loss per epoch).
I helped with presentations of our project in different segments.
#### Self-Assessment: Bootcamp program:
Even before pursuing this Bootcamp, I had been working on perfecting my Tableau, advanced SQL and other Data Analytical/Business Intelligence skills. This program, increased my horizon in the fields of Data Analytics and Business Intelligence in a great way. I feel extremely grateful to out Professor and TAs for the kind of learning and support they extended during the complete program.

## Team-Assessment
We were a team of highly motivated people who brought together a set of talents that we were proficient in or extremely passionate about. It was a great experience working together. We had fixed 3 days a week for our team meetings to discuss our plan of action for the week, our progress, the obstacles we were facing and how to tackle them, and anything that we had to work on in further sub groups. We were also in touch over slack to avoid any delays in any issues. We did have a limitation of evolving our data set, tools and technologies almost through the project due to a very different data set. We were able to collaborate and work through all challenges successfully due to our determination, focus and desire to perform. 

## Summary of Project
Created Machine Learning models for prediction of COVID-19 and Pneumonia cases from chest X-ray images using TensorFlow ML library and trying different pre-trained models like VGG16, Resnet18 etc. Developed effective storytelling and intuitive and interactive Tableau dashboard with animations for comparative and performance analysis of ML models to conclude VGG-16 model was the best performing model in terms of highest performance, lowest accuracy, consistent performance. Also, the model was not over or under fitted like the other models.
