# Final Assessment

## SelfAssessment

With GitHub being my primary role it touched every part of the project. Consolidating deliverable requirements by merging branches and clearing any access data off of the repository. I reviewed/verified photos and data is of great quality. I had an opportunity to work on parts of the presentation when all other roles were busy. I ensured we stayed inline with the Final Project Ruberic. I coordinated our final projects time management as well as orcerstrating placement of slides. I also made myself available for my team to take care of all administrative items that were needed, including storage was sufficient.

My greatest personal challenge was time management, the ability to balance my many hats in this environment created by Covid.  Intially I had a structured schecule allowing time for regular life situations (Job/kids/homework for kids.
With challenges prior to the project I learned how to get ahead of things after trial and error. I am an early bird so I made sure I changed my schedule to wake up at 3am to work on items that contributed to deliverables. 

## Team Assessment 

Group 1 is a great ambitous group of individuals who worked very well together. We mesh very well, we did not have any personality conflicts and everyone knew when to tone down allowing for everyone to have an equal say. In the first meeting we knew which role each of us was responsible for this allowed us to display our expertees as well as willingness to recieve asistans in areas assigned to others.  Not once did anyone give the perception that their role was of more importance than the other. We also ensured everyone met every deliverable prior to submission and if they did not we have a deliverable for their role they would alternate/asssist a role that was maintained by one with multipule roles. 

The main challenge with our communication protocol was the difference in time with one of our team memebers. They were 5 hours ahead of the remainder of the teams pacific time. We overcame this challenge by remaining flexable. Some days we would meet early to ensure everyone could attent zoom meetings. Our teammate also allowed themselves to work during the end of the day into the wee hours of the mornining. We also worked together in smaller groups of 2 or 3 when nessessary. That time allowed us to make connections outside of just a working group. We were more relatable and were able to become understanding to any hurdles an one of us are facing in the worlds current state. I think I would stay on the momentum built in the begining of the project allowing us to stay ahead of our project. We found ourselves way ahead of the time line and when it came to the final presentation we felt a little anxious. That is the only thing I can say that I would take as a lesson learned.

If I were given the opportunity to share with a new cohort kicking off the project I would let them know that time management is very important. Mistakes are bound to happen when they do take it as a lessons learned build off of it. its not about the mistake but how you respond that bounce back that matters, prepare for everything if possible. Most important of all communicate, communicate, communicate. Communication is one of the most undervalued tool that can cause a small item to make an issue blow up.  

Play off of everyones strenghts, if you have a more experienced person in one area and one who would like to become more versed in the same are allow them to assist. This will build their knowledge and experience not only benifiting that individual but the team. Someone who does a task on a normal basis may not be able to pickup on errors that one with new eyes to the process can. 

Everyones role is equally important, ones awarness of time can assist with ones ability to over look or be consumed in the projects detail causing an overage in time alloted to present. Somen one with attention to detail can assit with maintaining deliverable points that are considered small to the human ego. Its a group effort.


## Summary of Project

Our Covid-19 Prediction model uses X-ray images to predict if the image displays Covid-19, Viral Pneumonia or if it is normal. The model used is VGG16 as the Multiclass Classification Model. The model was able to accomplish exactly what is was built to do, predict at a high percentage accuracy rate.
