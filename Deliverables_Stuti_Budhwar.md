# RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINAL PROJECT: STUTI BUDHWAR

Over the tenure of the Final project, due to my love for analyzing large data sets using statistical & analytical knowledge to understand data trends, generate business insights and forecast outcomes using visulization techniques, I shall be mainly working on the **Vizualization** section. I shall however, be moving to support in other areas as required by the team along with my scope of work. 

In addition to using a **Flask** template, we will integrate 
**Tableau** for developing effective storytelling and fully functional, intuitive and interactive dashboards. It will be published on the **public tableau server**.

## Responsibilites for this segment:
### **Finalizing the project** (as a group)
We shortlisted the topic of 'The prediction model for 	various COVID-19 and non-COVID medical conditions from 	frontal chest X-ray of the patients' as it was not only 	relevant at this point in time, it was also stretching ourselves a little, by taking an image dataset rather than a regular one.
### **Finalization of the dataset for the topic** (as a group)
With multiple data sources available on the topic that caught our attention, we chose this data set of 5000 images of chest X-ray of patients which was a good number the train the dataset and apply machine learning models on. 
### **Finalized task and technologies** (as a group)
We worked on task and technologies to be used in all areas 	of the project. We might make a change on those through 	the course of the project if required.
### **Understanding the dataset** 
Understanding the dataset is particularly important in 	this project as we have image data here with a folder 	structure that would have to be altered for convinience 	and spliting into test/train data for the puprpose of 	applying machine leanrning models.
### **Presentation.md and README.md**
I worked on the **Presentation** section and the final **README.md** for the project for this week. This included research work on this particular dataset along with 		some others from kaggel, github and google to get more insight on the topic and check the authenticity of the two sources that this data was derived from.
