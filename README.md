# UCB_COVID_Prediction_Model *2nd Deliverable
## Overview
Our project came from a collective effort in determining that we want to do some analysis on COVID-19. With further research we came up with this Chest X-Ray image dataset that has multiple biological issues along with COVID-19. For our machine learning model, we are going to make a multi-class classification neural network using transfer learning with previous scaled weights optimized for images, such as VGG16 and ResNet50.

## Role in Project 
As the floater of the group, I will assist when I am needed in different areas. For this weeks deliverable I am dual hatted I have the GitHub and the Presentation portion. 

### Purpose
The purpose of my role as the Repository Administrator this week was to make sure all elements of the deliverable were included on the main branch. To make sure the main branch only contained the nessessary deliverables for the Teams final product for our presentation. With the responsibility of having the presentation portion is to update our teams progress and drafted slides for our final presentation.   

## Analysis and Challenges
With the review of the first merge we had to work on ensuring any information pushed to the main branch pertains to the finial product. The challenge of staying within the aloted storage space for the repository became a factor. I have and will continue to remove any items that do not relate to ensure storage is available for the durration or the project. I have also started a draft power point presentation. Looking ahead by outlining the presentation down to the time frame (minitue) the team has to present. 

### Description of the data exploration phase of the project
This week the decision with the inital project model of 14 classes did not have enough photos for our neural network to learn. There were low accuracy scores which led to narrowing the classes down to 3. The 3 classes are COVID19, Normal, and Viral_Pneumonia. A combination of covid pictures from the drop box dataset into the new dataset, verified by real sources the team found on Kaggle. More photos ensure the ability of the neural networks learning chances.

### Description of the analysis phase of the project
In our analysis the increase of epochs minimized our losses. Increasing the ephocs from 50, 100 and 200 in each learning model has shown better results.

## Communication protocols
The group agreed that meeting three times a week via Zoom would be very productive based on what was accomplished within the meetings that occurred outside of regularly scheduled classes.  We faced a challenge with one group member being in the eastern time zone for a short period of time with future travels back to Chile soon to follow.
Prior to finalizing our meetings for the week, we check with each other to see what time worked best due to the remainder of the group being flexible on their time.
We also communicate via our group Slack chat.  It was the best way to keep in touch with taking into account the time zone difference.   

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 As a GitHub Administrator I will need to make sure that the main branch does not contain duplicate documentation, all push requests do not contain conflicts within the items.  Bringing to the teams attention the pros and cons to limiting our accesses to one designated person being responsible to be able to merge to the main branch.  

## Results
I've accepted the challenge of being dual hatted knowing that my attention to detail with the presentations elements is apprectiated. The draft for the slides is prepared with information that the team will work to finalize. These are just a few things that I have had the opportunity to work on this week.
