# UCB_COVID_Prediction_Model
## Overview
In this project, we present the prediction model for various COVID-19 and non-COVID medical conditions from frontal chest X-ray of the patients. The need to streamline patient management for both COVID-19 and non-Covid conditions has become more pressing than ever. Chest X-rays provide a non-invasive (potentially bedside) tool to monitor the progression of the disease. Such a tool can gauge severity of the lung infections for these diseases that can be used for escalation or de-escalation of care as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in the ICU.

As the world grapples with multiple medical conditions, especially COVID-19, every ounce of technological innovation and ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and other infections brings us one step closer to overcoming it. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are playing a key role in better understanding and addressing, especially the COVID-19 crisis. Machine learning technology enables computers to mimic human intelligence and ingest large volumes of data to quickly identify patterns and insights. In the fight against these critical medical conditions, organizations have been quick to apply their machine learning expertise in several areas: scaling customer communications, understanding how they spread, and speeding up research and treatment. In this scenario, it is both relevant and useful to understand chest X-ray images to understand and develop an AI-based approach to predict and understand both COVID-19 and non Covid-19 diseases. 

## Role in Project
I have the responsibility of being the GitHub Repository Administrator for the group.  The groups branches are housed in my main repository that I am responsible for maintaing.  I am also considered the floater of the group, I will assist when I am needed in different areas.

### Purpose
The purpose of my role as the Repository Administrator this week was to create a repository with a main branch for our UCB COVID Prediction Model data.  Within that main branch there are five branches that belong to each group member who is responsible for a specific deliverable of our final product for our presentation.   

## Analysis and Challenges
Prior to creating the Repository, we worked as a group in selecting two data sets. We collaboratively reviewed the data sets to see which was best for what we wanted to accomplish with the data.  Once we were in agreement with the data set, we then had to establish the naming convention of our repository.  We wanted to ensure our repository’s name would easily identify our group as well as appear very professional for future use as an item in a business portfolio.  With those factors in consideration the group agreed on “UCB COVID Prediction Model “.  After the name was established, I moved forward with finalizing the Repository prior to distributing the repository link to the group.  The group agreed on creating their own branch via Zoom meeting to ensure all team members were able to create and see each branch within their git bash.  

### Communication protocols
The group agreed that meeting three times a week via Zoom would be very productive based on what was accomplished within the meetings that occurred outside of regularly scheduled classes.  We faced a challenge with one group member being in the eastern time zone for a short period of time with future travels back to Chile soon to follow.
Prior to finalizing our meetings for the week, we check with each other to see what time worked best due to the remainder of the group being flexible on their time.
We also communicate via our group Slack chat.  It was the best way to keep in touch with taking into account the time zone difference.   

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When distributing roles to group members for this week I did not understand what was expected for the GitHub deliverable.  I did not want to feel as if I was not contributing enough.  At first glance, I asked myself what would I write in my README document. While working with the group there were may things that we did not take into account with merging our individual branches commits into the main branch.  As a GitHub Administrator I will need to make sure that the main branch does not contain duplicate documentation, all push requests do not contain conflicts within the items.  Bringing to the teams attention the pros and cons to limiting our accesses to one designated person being responsible to be able to merge to the main branch. 

## Results
I've accepted the challenge of becoming more versed in GitHub by doing research on managing branches.  I created my branch with my first name and to line up and stay consistent with the groups naming convention I’ve learned how to change branch names.  I have also worked on granting and/or restricting access to the main branch.  These are just a few things that I have had the opportunity to learn this week.
